        overview: `
        This project's goal was to modernize an architecturally robust but experientially lagging digital commerce suite to meet evolving retail demands and capitalize on emerging technologies like AI, ONDC, and Retail Media Networks.
        `,
        
        challenge: `
        The core challenge was to shift the product strategy from being feature-led to experience-led. This required integrating fundamentally new technologies (like Agentic AI and network commerce) into a mature platform without disrupting existing clients, while simultaneously proving the business case for this significant investment to stakeholders.
        `,
        
        solution: `
        My approach was to lead with a data-driven strategy. I directed extensive market and user research to identify key pain points and opportunities. I then architected the strategic frameworks for ONDC and RMN integration, and oversaw the design and implementation of Agentic AI for personalization, virtual advisors, and advanced search, ensuring each feature was tied to a clear business metric.
